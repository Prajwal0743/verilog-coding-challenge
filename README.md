# Rtl coding
contents
Basic Modules: Simple designs such as logic gates, multiplexers, and demultiplexers.
Sequential Circuits: Flip-flops, counters, and shift registers.
Finite State Machines (FSMs): Implementation of both Mealy and Moore state machines.
Test Benches: Accompanying test benches for each module to verify functionality.
Project-Based Learning: Small projects that integrate multiple concepts to solve practicalÂ problems.
